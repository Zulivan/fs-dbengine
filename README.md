# FS-DBENGINE
Because __fsdb__ was already used...

This module allows you to save data without having a real database server running outside your code __quite__ easily.

This solution is an experiment despite the fact that it is ~~theoretically stable~~ in beta.

#### I don't know what to think about it... Even the idea of someone who will ever try it and give their feedback happens to be miraculous.
